# vMenu-ox

This is a fork of vMenu designed to integrate with [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/latest) you will require it for this to work.

This fork introduces some new exports that work with ox_lib for better UI features and to make the menu more convenient/easier to use for players.

Here's an example where we can move away from 3 separate input popups for rgb number values and to ox_lib's native inputDialog where the user can easily select a custom colour and visually see what they're choosing.

# Fork Features/Changes

### Core/UI

- Input Dialog Replace
  - Replaces the base game user input and replaces with ox_lib input dialog for easier use such as copy/pasting spawncodes etc.
- User Confirmations
  - Important actions like weather/time changes have user confirmation buttons preventing unwanted mishaps with a misclick.

## Code Share System
For code sharing to function, you will require [oxmysql](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql/releases)<br>
If you have oxmysql, you can enable the outfit/vehicle sharing systems in the `permissions.cfg`

This is a custom sharing system I designed for vMenu to follow similar behaviour i've seen in some clothing creators on economy servers.
This allows for super easy & simple sharing MP ped configurations between players and eventually vehicles is the plan.

Players create unique codes for a saved MP Ped and can give that code out where others can then load said outfit keeping their unique characteristics like hair, tattoos etc but getting clothing & prop options allowing super easy sharing!

_Say goodbye to huge spreadsheets with different numbers and say hello to simple one code input for your roleplay servers!_

### Vehicle

- Colour Selector
  - Gives users a hex selector for custom colour setting within vehicle options (primary/secondary)
- New Permissions
  - Bulletproof Tires `vMenu.VehicleOptions.BulletproofTires` (default: denied)
- Fixed getting disarmed (weapon taken away) when locking/unlocking personal vehicles
- Implemented cooldown between usage of close all doors to patch exploit to make cars float/fly
- Configurable cooldown when spawning vehicles to prevent players from spam spawning vehicles
  - `setr vmenu_vehicle_spawner_cooldown 1000`

### Weather

- Added convar `vmenu_blackout_affect_vehicles` (default: false) so that vehicle headlights/police lightbars continue to operate during blackouts

### Misc

- Keybinds for Thermal & Night Vision Modes
  - This is locked to users that have the permissions assigned to them.

- Patched vulnerability on weather events that could easily be exploited - thanks to [this pull](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu/pull/430/) that isn't merged as of 7th Jan 25.
- Disable AI with ease, with a simple convar in your permissions.cfg - `set vmenu_disable_ai true` (false by default)

### Devtools

- Auto freeze entites created with the entity spawner menu (to avoid them falling through map automatically on contact)
- Copy Coordinates Button (vector4)
- Copy Vehicle Model Hash

# Developer Integrations

Below is information related to exposed events/functions you can use in your resources to integrate your server better with vMenu.
In the FiveM resource, head to the `client` & `server` folders and you will see files labelled `integrations`.

Here you will find any events/exports for use and you can implement your server specific needs.

**Example Client Event:**
```lua
---@class logAction
---@field action string
---@field data table
AddEventHandler("vMenu:Integrations:Action", function(action, data)
    if action == "infinitefuel" then
        ---@class data table
        ---@field enabled boolean
        lib.print.debug("Infinite Fuel: " .. tostring(data.enabled))
    elseif action == "licenseplate" then
        ---@class data table
        ---@field handle integer
        ---@field plate string
        lib.print.debug("License Plate Updated: " .. data.handle .. " - " .. data.plate)
        --[[
            Example Usage:
            if doesTextContainBlacklistedWord(plate) then
                SetVehicleNumberPlateText(handle, "PLATE")
                TriggerServerEvent("banplayer")
            end
        --]]
    elseif action == "noclip" then
        ---@class data table
        ---@field enabled boolean
        lib.print.debug("NoClip: " .. tostring(data.enabled)) 
    end
end)
```

We also built a handy export for developers to block simple actions like spawning vehicles in restricted areas (jail, whilst dead etc)

```lua
---@field type string
exports("canDoInteraction", function(action)
    if action == "spawnvehicle" then
      if exports.core.isJailed() then return false end -- would block the user from spawning vehicles in jail.
    end
    return true
end)
```

### To-Do / Suggested Ideas
- [x] Alphabetically sort weapons in categories
- [ ] Implement ids into notifications to cleanup / stop duplicate spammy notifications
- [ ] Sync Time/Weather into GlobalStates
- [ ] Add new event for ban manager so that developers can easily integrate their own anticheat/banning functions for event exploiters
- [x] Ratelimit on close all/open all doors (exploit to make cars fly)
- [x] Configurable vehicle spawn cooldown
- [ ] Take weapon spawning functionality out of c# and add export for LUA so that devs can easily integrate ox_inventory
- [ ] Export to add weapons + attachments into vmenu categories without them having to rebuild [REMOVE ADDON WEAPON SUBMENU / CODE] (maybe this gets extended to peds/vehicles?)
- [x] Add a export before weapon/vehicle spawning/teleports such as isRestrained() so developers can easily block actions and add their own cuff/death scripts etc
- [x] ~~Separate branch (maybe?) for outfit/weapon/vehicle code system~~ Planned to go ahead in main fork and add dependency of oxmysql as most servers use it. Maybe ill just do a resource check so if the resource isnt installed the buttons just error and say plugin not installed or smth?
- [x] Update weapon attachment right button if it is equipped (checkmark)
- [x] Copy Coords Button (devtools)
- [x] Ability to save BP tires on vehicles? (would need to perm check on re-apply)
- [x] Add an event that is triggered when infinite fuel is enabled so developers can easily integrate with scripts other than FRFUEL
